# Employee-Promtion
The HR team stored data of promotion cycle last year, which consists of details of all the employees in the company working last year and also 
if they got promoted or not, but every time this process gets delayed due to so many details available for each employee - it gets difficult to compare and decide.
We will build a model from stored data, that will predict if a person is eligible for promotion or not.
Time Line of the Project:
Importing Libraries and DataSet
Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
Model building using ML models
